```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


- Take the first faceted plot in this section:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
```

What are the advantages to using faceting instead of the colour aesthetic? What are the disadvantages? How might the balance change if you had a larger dataset?

- Recreate the R code necessary to generate the following graphs.

```{r, out.width=200}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0("plots/fig", 1:6, ".png"))
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, group = drv)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), se = FALSE)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, linetype = drv), se = FALSE)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, fill = drv), shape = 21, color = "white", stroke = 2)
```

- Most geoms and stats come in pairs that are almost always used in concert. Read through the documentation and make a list of all the pairs. What do they have in common?

- Compare and contrast geom_jitter() with geom_count().
```{r}
?geom_jitter
?geom_count
```
- What does the plot below tell you about the relationship between city and highway mpg (fuel consumption)?
they are coorespond
Why is coord_fixed() important?
coordinates X = Y
What does geom_abline() do?

These geoms add reference lines (sometimes called rules) to a plot, either horizontal, vertical, or diagonal (specified by slope and intercept). These are useful for annotating plots.
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_abline() +
  coord_fixed()
```

- What is the default geom associated with stat_summary()?
geom_pointrange
```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  stat_summary(
    mapping = aes(x = cut, y = depth),
    fun.ymin = min,
    fun.ymax = max,
    fun.y = median
  )
```

How could you rewrite the previous plot to use that geom function instead of the stat function?

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_errorbar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = depth),
    ymin = 0,
    ymax = 10
  )
```

 
- What does geom_col() do? How is it different to geom_bar()?
There are two types of bar charts: geom_bar() and geom_col(). geom_bar() makes the height of the bar proportional to the number of cases in each group (or if the weight aesthetic is supplied, the sum of the weights). If you want the heights of the bars to represent values in the data, use geom_col() instead. geom_bar() uses stat_count() by default: it counts the number of cases at each x position. geom_col() uses stat_identity(): it leaves the data as is.
- What variables does stat_smooth() compute? What parameters control its behaviour?
Aids the eye in seeing patterns in the presence of overplotting. geom_smooth() and stat_smooth() are effectively aliases: they both use the same arguments. Use stat_smooth() if you want to display the results with a non-standard geom
- In our proportion bar chart, we need to set group = 1. Why? In other words what is the problem with these two graphs?
Every proportion = 1
```{r}
diamonds
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = ..prop..))
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = color, y = ..prop..))
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = color), position = "fill")
```
